## Visual-Mujam

**Current version is** [here](Mujam.html)

_Mujam_ is the general name for the books with a complete index of all the words in Quran. Latin name is Concordance.

For instance, the word _Adam_ occurs 25 times in Quran. _Concordantiae_ by G Flügel shows _Adam_ on [this page](https://archive.org/stream/concordantiaeco00flgoog#page/n28/mode/2up)

Then comes computer software. [Here is the list](http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=adm) of all occurrences of the same word with links to follow.

Our aim in this project is to present the word list in a visual context. At the start of the project, several sample words were prepared manually. The challenge was to make similar pages automatically for each of the 4700 distinct words in Quran...

### Limitations

V1.4 omits only 5 words that occur more than 500 times each: <br>
Allāh, rabb, qāla, kāna, āmana -- all other words are indexed


### Earlier test runs

Several visual models were applied before using real data:
* [Test2](first/test2.html) Links to the pages containing the word
* [Test3](first/test3.html) Links to all pages (4 sample words)
* [Test4](first/test4.html) All roots starting with letter _Sad_
